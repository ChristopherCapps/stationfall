	.GSTR STR?99,"The quiet, dusty corridors stir disturbing memories. You're back on Resida, the deserted, plague-stricken world where you met Floyd. A hot flush creeps over you, indicating that the virulent disease that conquered this planet is beginnning its insidious work on you"
	.GSTR STR?100,"You are strolling across Deck Four of the Duffy, when suddenly you remember that you were supposed to have Handwriting Legibility Evaluation Forms -- all nine parts, for every member of the crew -- on Captain Fussbottom's desk by 7800. It's 7790, and those forms are stored on the other side of the ship. You try to run, but the floor is covered with glue. You can hear the Captain calling your name, louder and louder, as you struggle to move your legs"
	.GSTR STR?101,"You gulp down the last of your Ramosian Fire Nectar and ask the andro-waiter for another pitcher. This pub makes the finest Nectar on all of Ramos Two, and you and your shipmates are having a pretty rowdy time. Through the windows of the pub you can see a mighty, ancient castle, shining in the light of the three Ramosian moons. The Fire Nectar spreads through your blood and you begin to feel drowsy"
	.GSTR STR?102,"You wake up in a huge stadium, watching an important ceremony. It's a Stellar Patrol promotion ceremony on Tremain! Suddenly your own name echoes over the PA system -- and down below you see YOURSELF walking up the steps to the stage! The presiding admiral describes your heroism on Resida, mentioning that you were awarded the key to the planet, and then asks the ceremonial question, ""Do you accept promotion to Lieutenant First Class?"" You try to yell ""No!"" from the stands, but the words are lost in the vastness of the stadium"
	.GSTR STR?103,"You find yourself in a spacepod outside the docking bays of a large space station. All the doors are closed. You snap on the radio, and discover that Floyd is in charge within the station. ""Open the pod bay doors, Floyd,"" you tell him but he replies, ""I'm sorry, I can't do that,"" and begins laughing and your air is beginning to run out"
	.GSTR STR?104,"At last, the Duffy is approaching station Delta Upsilon Upsilon Phi -- your first rec leave in almost six months. It's even worth the six solid days of paperwork necessary for a standard half-day leave. Stationfall is millichrons away, but suddenly you realize that you're all alone on the Duffy! Frantic, you dash to the deserted bridge, but it's too late to stop the out-of-control Duffy from ramming the massive space station! The hull of the station rushes toward you"
	.GSTR STR?105,"You dream of being buried alive in an ancient Egyptian pyramid, inside the sarcophagus with some long-dead pharaoh. Phew, does he stink! You gasp and gag as the air in the coffin runs low.
   This dream, incidentally, is not a particularly unusual one among people who go to sleep inside space suits with limited oxygen supplies."
	.GSTR STR?106,"A movement awakens you in the middle of the night! Through unfocused eyes you see a large machine rolling menacingly closer! A bright light leaps from it, straight toward..."
	.GSTR STR?107,"You collapse from extreme thirst and hunger."
	.GSTR STR?108,"A powerful arc of raw energy bridges the gap between two of the monster's welding extensions. Unfortunately, you were pretty much right between the same two extensions at that moment."

	.GSTR STR?130,"Like most fromitz boards, it is a twisted maze of silicon circuits. It is square, approximately seventeen centimeters on each side.
"
	.GSTR STR?131,"You're neither hungry nor thirsty.
"
	.GSTR STR?132,"Floyd is leaning against the wall, his head lolling to the side. Apparently, someone has heartlessly turned him off."
	.GSTR STR?133,"The only part of the complex robot authorization equipment that is visible to you is a slot (for inserting your form) and a keypad (for typing your selection)."
	.GSTR STR?134,"Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms"
	.GSTR STR?135,"The thick side wall of the tank has been blasted open"
	.GSTR STR?136,"Next time, say what number to set it to.

	.GSTR STR?137,", hopping mad. ""Why you turn Floyd off?"" he asks accusingly."

	.GSTR STR?142,"Lieutenant First Class"
	.GSTR STR?143,"Through the large, dirty window, you can see Dan's used spaceship lot. The spaceships floating in Dan's lot all have their prices whitewashed on their viewports, along with phrases like ""A steal!"" and ""Just reduced!"""
	.GSTR STR?144,"You are already in that mode.
"
	.GSTR STR?145,"That might get you into serious trouble as a violation of the Comprehensive Forms Destruction and Mutilation Act of 11309 GY.

	.GSTR STR?146,"ou hear the welder move off in another direction.
"
	.GSTR STR?147,", of course, no longer attached to the detonator.)"
	.GSTR STR?148,"The form is swallowed up, followed by a long pause for triple-redundancy processing. "
	.GSTR STR?149,"The form is rejected. "
	.GSTR STR?150,"suddenly sublimes into a puff of FREZONE (tm) gas."
	.GSTR STR?151,"For those unfamiliar with PLANETFALL, "
	.GSTR STR?152,"
   You have entered a cluttered space bubble "
	.GSTR STR?153," in the center... Oops. At second glance, you realize that the "
	.GSTR STR?154," between the arms of the frozen exercise machine, smoke pouring from its engine vents like steam from the nostrils of an angry bull."
	.GSTR STR?155,"You detach the detonator from "
	.GSTR STR?156,"   The ostrich gives a pathetic squawk of terror "
	.GSTR STR?157,"ou can just make out a letter ""M.""
"
	.GSTR STR?158," and lands on the floor."
	.GSTR STR?159,", and a ladder leads both upward and downward."
	.GSTR STR?160,"That's too long to wait.
"
	.GSTR STR?161,"You are in the heart of the administrative level of the ship, the largest level of the S.P.S. Duffy or any other Stellar Patrol ship for that matter. The corridor continues starboard and a room lies aft of here. Through the door to port lies the bulk of the Duffy. Next to the door is a slot."
	.GSTR STR?162,"You must insert a validated Assignment Completion Form in the slot"

	.GSTR STR?165,"The room is filled to the ceiling with row upon row of pallets filled with boxes. Each box has some writing stamped on the side."
	.GSTR STR?166,"The deck five corridor ends here at the entrance to the cargo bay, to starboard. A smaller entrance leads fore."
	.GSTR STR?167,"He's an amusing and friendly little fellow."

	.GSTR STR?192,"produces a loud burp and fails to apologize"
	.GSTR STR?193,"mumbles about a mysterious future in which humans will have to take orders from robots"
	.GSTR STR?194,"tells an off-color joke about the bizarre mating habits of flesh and blood creatures"
	.GSTR STR?195,"Floyd tells Plato about a neat shortcut for calculating seventh order differentials"
	.GSTR STR?196,"Plato tells Floyd one of the ancient legends about the early days of the settlement of the galaxy"
	.GSTR STR?197,"Floyd confides to Plato that his life's dream is to get locked up overnight in a toy factory"
	.GSTR STR?198,"Floyd and Plato discuss their favorite battery recharging techniques"
	.GSTR STR?199,"Plato helps polish a hard-to-reach spot on Floyd's back"
	.GSTR STR?200,"""You like Floyd, don't you, Plato?"" asks Floyd. ""Yes,"" replies the taller robot, ""you're the only robot I've ever met who doesn't call me a nerd."" Floyd smiles"
	.GSTR STR?201,"In a very sad voice, Floyd talks of his friend Lazarus, a medical robot on Resida who was tragically disassembled. Plato responds, ""Now, Floyd, don't fill your head with the sad memories of Lazarus' death. Think instead about the joy-filled times when you and your friend were together."" Floyd seems awed by such wisdom"
	.GSTR STR?202,"Floyd gives Plato a friendly hug"
	.GSTR STR?203,"Floyd stubs his toe and begins to whimper. ""There, there,"" says Plato, ""such a reaction will not reduce the level of pain."" He gives Floyd a little tickle, and Floyd begins giggling and forgets the injury"
	.GSTR STR?204,"Bin number two holds a spindly little robot, a specialized model designed for bursting and decollating multi-part forms. A tiny nameplate on her perforating extension reads ""Helen."""
	.GSTR STR?205,"In the first bin is a bulky robot, obviously intended for heavy lifting. A brass plate on one of his pneumatic arm lifts says ""Rex."""
	.GSTR STR?206,"   Rex trundles after you. Unfortunately, Rex is not too bright on his best days, and today is not one of them. He forgets to stop when you do; sixteen tons of Rex turn you into a human pancake."

	.GSTR STR?222," apricot yogurt"
	.GSTR STR?223,"This is a fairly large space where much of the maintenance work for the station takes place. Some repair work for visiting ships is also done here. The room is filled with all sorts of repair and fabrication machinery. A door leads south, and there's an opening to the north."
	.GSTR STR?224,"I'm really not at all mechanically inclined. My sincerest apologies."
	.GSTR STR?225,"It's a kind of a thingamabob for putting in a, you know, a whosiwhatsis."
	.GSTR STR?226,"This is one of the storage areas. Exits lie to the east and south."
	.GSTR STR?227,"twenty tiny sockets"
	.GSTR STR?228,"The central corridor continues around to the southeast and southwest, but another corridor joins from the north. There's a door to the east and a doorway to the northeast."
	.GSTR STR?229,"The corridor widens here as it approaches the skin of the space station at the point where a Scientific Sub-Module would connect. Sure enough, the connecting tube of a Sub-Module begins just to the north! An auto-door lies to the west. Opposite it, a doorway leads east."
	.GSTR STR?230,"This is the shop for station personnel, selling everything from postcards to chewing gum at inflated prices. Exits lead west and southwest."
	.GSTR STR?231,"In the corner of the PX is a Stellar Patrol dispensing machine, consisting of a screen (displaying the dispenser's ""exciting"" offerings), a slot (for coin insertion), a keypad (for typing your selection), and a hole (where the dispensed item hopefully -- but rarely -- arrives)."

	.GSTR STR?235,"Surrounding the beds of this infirmary is the finest diagnostic equipment that unlimited Stellar Patrol budgets can buy. To the east, an ID reader indicates a security door. You can leave to the west or southeast."

	.GSTR STR?237,"lock"
	.GSTR STR?238,"The corridor continues around to the northwest and southwest, and an adjoining one heads east."
	.GSTR STR?239,"This central corridor turns northeast and northwest of here. A second corridor begins here and leads south. There are doorways to the southwest, southeast, and east."
	.GSTR STR?240," The shock seems to have been a bit too much for your heart."
	.GSTR STR?241,"This is the room where octuplet copies of important forms are stored. Since it is only about a hundred square meters, this room cannot hold more than a few days worth of storage before being dumped to nanofilm. Mercifully, there is an exit to the northeast."
	.GSTR STR?242,"reader"
	.GSTR STR?243,"   The log reader explodes!"
	.GSTR STR?244,"These are by far the nicest living quarters on the station, with separate sleeping, changing, and working cubicles, and a private SanFac. The only exit is west."
	.GSTR STR?245,"Sitting on the Commander's desk is an ordinary-looking log tape. There's a notation printed on it."
	.GSTR STR?246,"""Commander's Log -- 11349.12.2 through 11349.12.4"""
	.GSTR STR?247,"A sturdy safe is welded to the deck next to the desk."

	.GSTR STR?249,"hole"
	.GSTR STR?250,"This is the Station Commander's conference room. Doors point north and west."
	.GSTR STR?251,"This is a secondary weapons storage deck, but the only weapon deck on a station with no Military Sub-Module. Exit: south."
	.GSTR STR?252,"This is a wide but not very tall docking bay. The station entrance lies to the east."
	.GSTR STR?253,"""Spacetruck Refueling Instructions"
	.GSTR STR?254,"This cramped dormitory, composed of approximately twenty private cubicles, curves around the northern half of this level, with exits to the southeast and southwest."
	.GSTR STR?255,"You enter one of the cubicles but find nothing of interest."
	.GSTR STR?256,"This warren of tiny cubicles fills the southern half of this level, curving toward exits in the northeast and northwest corners."
	.GSTR STR?257,"This is a crowded but otherwise typical sanitary facility, with rows of showers, toilet stalls, and sinks. There are exits both north and south."
	.GSTR STR?258,"A multiple-function exercise machine sits imposingly on one side of the gym. There is a sign above it."
	.GSTR STR?259," hums encouraging platitudes as it exercises you to death."
	.GSTR STR?260,"In the corner, next to the dryer, is a large empty spot where the washer should be."
	.GSTR STR?261,"lurches forward and slams shut on your arm. Before you pass out from the pain, you hear a rumbling sound from the presser, but you can't decide whether it sounds more like a chuckle or a burp."
	.GSTR STR?262,"""Chapel Maintenance Procedures"
	.GSTR STR?263,"This sixty-seat auditorium is used for lectures, certain large briefings, an occasional live entertainment, and a rare live broadcast over deep-space channels. A projection booth dominates the rear of the room. The theatre's only exit is to the north."
	.GSTR STR?264,"Aaarghhh! The coffee is poisoned! It's eating away at your insides!!"
	.GSTR STR?265,"This is the primary storage room of the station, with large stockpiles of important items. For example, basic organic materials are needed to supplement the food supply due to the tiny inefficiencies of the recycling process. This is nearly the top level of the Command Module, and the ceiling curves in sharply over the supply room, which curves around to doors at the northwestern and southwestern ends."
	.GSTR STR?266,"detonator"
	.GSTR STR?267,"This is a medium-sized conference room with doors to the south and west."
	.GSTR STR?268,"This is a fairly large conference room with north and south exits."
	.GSTR STR?269,"This station's library has some printed material, such as recently transmitted magazines, but primarily it is a location for reading nanofilm spools, using the spool reader, and accessing the main computer's data banks via a computer terminal. Strangely, the computer terminal has been removed from the room. There's a door to the north and an exit to the west."
	.GSTR STR?270,"Magazines are not to be removed from the library"
	.GSTR STR?271,"You stroll down one of the pebbled paths. It circles the garden, passing more exotic plants, and returns to the area near the elevator."

	.GSTR STR?273,"open the grating"
	.GSTR STR?274,"These cubicles are for use by any visitors or station personnel beyond the normal complement. The entire barracks seem to be unused as well as deserted. The exit lies to the south, and the barracks curve around to the east."
	.GSTR STR?275,"This is the rather ordinary sanitary facility for the barracks to the north."
	.GSTR STR?276,"This is the station's largest docking bay. A huge door to the east leads into the station.
   Resting in the docking bay is a small ship of obviously alien origin. An open hatch seems to beckon you inward."
	.GSTR STR?277,"Must be a connect-the-dots! And a real easy one, too! None of those dumb numbers to confuse you! Where's my crayon?"
	.GSTR STR?278,"Hmmm. Some kind of alien writing, I presume. If I recall, the Mayor is an expert on that subject."
	.GSTR STR?279,"Lying under the dots is a skeleton, the brittle remains of a member of some unfamiliar alien race."

   Schmidt traced back the path of the alien ship; the path points out of the galaxy without nearing any star system. Further, extending the path leads straight to one of our smaller neighboring galaxies. Schmidt concludes that the ship and the pyramid are probably well over one billion years old!
   Next, Schmidt studied the wall markings in the alien ship. A series of identical dots, they defied every computerized model of linguistic decipherment! Then, in an inspiration, Schmidt studied the dots for nonvisual properties. His diary vaguely refers to a breakthrough, saying, ""I guess my pal, the mayor, will get to show off his linguistic training.""
   Finally, Schmidt began concentrating his studies on the pyramid itself. He was able to discover very little, blaming this primarily on the unexplained failures of several crucial pieces of lab machinery."
